## Housing Price Analysis  

Determining the price of a house also depends on various factors such as building area, exterior quality, and amenities. This dataset provides information on properties for sale, and through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), patterns and key factors affecting house prices can be identified.

Goals:  
- Cleaning and preparing data, including handling missing values (NaN).
- Analyzed the distribution of numerical and categorical variables using 1D visualizations.
- Analyze relationships between variables using 2D visualizations to see how certain factors affect house prices.
- Gain insights that can help in decision-making related to property valuation.

Insights:  
- Analysis of the Housing Price dataset shows that Ground Living Area (GrLivArea) has a strong positive correlation with house price (SalePrice), making it a major factor in determining property value.
- Garage Area is also influential, although the correlation is weaker.
- The distribution of house prices tends to be right-skewed, with some outliers in the form of houses that are priced very high or low relative to their size and features.
- Other factors such as exterior quality (ExterQual) also contribute significantly to price, while Utilities have a smaller influence.
- The log-10 transformation helps normalize the price distribution for more accurate analysis.

Conclusion:  
- Overall, house prices are affected by a combination of square footage, amenities, and other external factors, so a holistic approach is required in property analysis.
